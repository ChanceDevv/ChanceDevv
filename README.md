- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chancey
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, theatre and online radio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about databases (Mongo DB) and I am trying to get better node.js/discord.js. I am also working on a bot for a streamer which I will add a repository for it once I have finished it. One point in time, I want to make a bot dashboard.
- ðŸ¤— I am working on a website all about me and my projects
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: If you ever need to contact me, my discord is Chancey#3548.
